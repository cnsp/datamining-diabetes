   abstract = {Diabetes is a disease that has no permanent cure; hence early detection is required. Data mining, machine learning (ML) algorithms, and Neural Network (NN) methods are used in diabetes prediction in our research. We used the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset for our research, collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about 768 patients and their corresponding nine unique attributes. We used seven ML algorithms on the dataset to predict diabetes. We found that the model with Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) works well on diabetes prediction. We built the NN model with a different hidden layer with various epochs and observed the NN with two hidden layers provided 88.6% accuracy.},

   abstract = {Background Logistic regression is a classification model in machine learning, extensively used in clinical analysis. It uses probabilistic estimations which helps in understanding the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Diabetes, being one of the most common diseases around the world, when detected early, may prevent the progression of the disease and avoid other complications. In this work, we design a prediction model, that predicts whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset, and explore various techniques to boost the performance and accuracy. Methods Logistic Regression is the main algorithm used in this paper and the analysis is carried out using Python IDE. The experiment mainly uses two datasets – one is the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, which is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the other dataset is from Vanderbilt, which is based on a study of rural African Americans in Virginia. Feature selection is carried out using two different methods. Ensemble methods are further used, that improve performance by producing better predictions compared to a single model. Results The accuracy and runtimes are captured for the original datasets and also for the ones obtained after using feature selection and ensemble techniques. A comparison is also shown in each case. The highest accuracy obtained was around 78% for Dataset 1, after employing the ensemble technique- Max Voting; and it was around 93% for Dataset 2, after using the ensemble techniques- Max Voting, and Stacking. Conclusion Logistic Regression has shown to be one of the efficient algorithms in building prediction models. This study also shows that apart from the choice of algorithms, there are other factors that could improve the accuracy and runtimes of the model, such as: data-preprocessing, removal of redundant and null values, normalization, cross-validation, feature selection, and usage of ensemble techniques.},

	abstract = {Background and objective Diabetes is a silent killer. The main cause of this disease is the presence of excessive amounts of metabolites such as glucose. There were about 387 million diabetic people all over the world in 2014. The financial burden of this disease has been calculated to be about \$13,700 per year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), these figures will more than double by the year 2030. This cost will be reduced dramatically if someone can predict diabetes statistically on the basis of some covariates. Although several classification techniques are available, it is very difficult to classify diabetes. The main objectives of this paper are as follows: (i) Gaussian process classification (GPC), (ii) comparative classifier for diabetes data classification, (iii) data analysis using the cross-validation approach, (iv) interpretation of the data analysis and (v) benchmarking our method against others. Methods To classify diabetes, several classification techniques are used such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and Naive Bayes (NB). However, most of the medical data show non-normality, non-linearity and inherent correlation structure. So in this paper we adapted Gaussian process (GP)-based classification technique using three kernels namely: linear, polynomial and radial basis kernel. We also investigate the performance of a GP-based classification technique in comparison to existing techniques such as LDA, QDA and NB. Performances are evaluated by using the accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results Pima Indian diabetes dataset is taken as part of the study. This consists of 768 patients, of which 268 patients are diabetic and 500 patients are controls. Our machine learning system shows the performance of GP-based model as: ACC 81.97\%, SE 91.79\%, SP 63.33\%, PPV 84.91\% and NPV 62.50\% which are larger compared to other methods.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, especially in developed nations. In recent years, it has become rampant in the developing nations such as Nigeria, posing more threats to individuals in the latter than those in the former. More than 415 million people were reported to suffer from DM worldwide as of 2015, with type 2 of the disease accounting for approximately 90\% of the cases. The number of people with DM is expected to rise to 592 million by the year 2035. Therefore, DM is one of the growing public health concerns in Nigeria. In this study, the diagnostic dataset of DM type 2 was collected from the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, Kano, and used to develop predictive supervised machine learning models based on logistic regression, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, naive Bayes and gradient booting algorithms. The random forest predictive learning-based model appeared to be one of the best developed models with 88.76\% in terms of accuracy; however, in terms of receiver operating characteristic curve, random forest and gradient booting predictive learning-based models were found to be the best predictive learning models with 86.28\% predictive ability, respectively.},

	abstract = {It is often assumed that there is little or no sex bias within either Type I (insulin-dependent) or Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. This review considers evidence that sex effects of interest and importance are present in both forms of the disease. Type I diabetes is the only major organ-specific autoimmune disorder not to show a strong female bias. The overall sex ratio is roughly equal in children diagnosed under the age of 15 but while populations with the highest incidence all show male excess, the lowest risk populations studied, mostly of non-European origin, characteristically show a female bias. In contrast, male excess is a consistent finding in populations of European origin aged 15-40 years, with an approximate 3:2 male:female ratio. This ratio has remained constant in young adults over two or three generations in some populations. Further, fathers with Type I diabetes are more likely than affected mothers to transmit the condition to their offspring. Women of childbearing age are therefore less likely to develop Type I diabetes, and--should this occur--are less likely to transmit it to their offspring. Type II diabetes showed a pronounced female excess in the first half of the last century but is now equally prevalent among men and women in most populations, with some evidence of male preponderance in early middle age. Men seem more susceptible than women to the consequences of indolence and obesity, possibly due to differences in insulin sensitivity and regional fat deposition. Women are, however, more likely to transmit Type II diabetes to their offspring. Understanding these experiments of nature might suggest ways of influencing the early course of both forms of the disease.},
